## About the making

It was made in 2015 as an indie game to compete in .io genre (This was my first .io game inspired by other huge io games at the time)

## About the versions:
Every single change is submitted and documented as files and backups on my backup hard drives, If you have any request or question about previus versions of this game or any other of my fames, you should call me, I am unable to document every single of my changes on GitHub so everything is backed up other places and only the final version/versions are here.
<I have the code from empty to full final version as files!>

## Reason of being open source
Github private repository is forbidden in my country so I decided to make all of my games open source for the public
